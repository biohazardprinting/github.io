      <h1><strong>About the Owner and Biohazard Printing</strong></h1>
      <p>
        Allow me to introduce myself - I'm Derek, the mastermind behind
        Biohazard Printing, a <span id="age"></span>-year-old resident of
        northern Ohio. Nestled in this cozy corner of the world, I navigate the
        intricacies of life alongside my wife and kids, juggling the
        responsibilities of family, work, and my ever-expanding passion project.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, how did this wild ride begin, you ask? Well, picture this: a
        regular guy with a full-time gig, just tinkering away in his spare time,
        turning random ideas into tangible creations. That was me, until one
        fateful day when lightning struck and those creations morphed into
        something more than just a hobby. Suddenly, I found myself on the cusp
        of a new adventure, one brimming with endless possibilities and
        unforeseen twists.
      </p>
      <p>
        But wait, rewind a bit. How did I come up with the name Biohazard
        Printing? Well, gather 'round and let me share the tale. Several years
        ago (seems like forever ago) I served in the United States Army as a
        74D, a Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Specialist. Don't
        let the title get ya, it's a fancy title for saying you're there to
        clean up a BIG mess. From those military days, the concept of biological
        warfare stuck with me, intertwined with memories of donning protective
        gear and navigating new territories. Thus, the name "Biohazard" was
        born, inspired by my military experiance.
      </p>
      <p>
        As fate would have it, 3D printing emerged as the cornerstone of my
        newfound venture. With every nozzle pass of the printer, my imagination
        ran wild, sculpting wonders out of mere plastic. Since 3D printing was
        the first big thing my business did, that's how the "Printing" name came
        into play, and alas, <b><u>Biohazard Printing</u></b
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        But the adventure didn't stop there. As my business grew, so did my
        repertoire of skills. I have since ventured into laser engraving, custom
        apparel, custom images, and even website building. With each new
        endeavor, I discovered new passions and honed my craft, pushing the
        boundaries of what Biohazard Printing could achieve. And here's the
        kicker â€“ due to a change in career path, I've been able to dedicate even
        more time to my business, leveraging the skills and experiences gained
        from my day job to fuel my entrepreneurial pursuits. It's not just about
        creating anymore; it's about exploring new horizons and finding beauty
        in the unexpected.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, won't you join me on this remarkable journey? Together, let's
        venture into uncharted territories, where creativity knows no bounds and
        every day brings new discoveries.
